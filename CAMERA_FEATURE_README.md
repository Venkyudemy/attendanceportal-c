## üîß API Endpoints

### **Check-In with Image**
```
POST /api/employee/:id/check-in-with-image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- image: File (JPG/PNG)
- type: 'checkin'

Response:
{
  "message": "Check-in successful",
  "checkInTime": "09:00 AM",
  "status": "Present",
  "isLate": false,
  "employeeName": "John Doe",
  "imagePath": "/uploads/attendance-images/123_checkin_1234567890.jpg",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T09:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Check-Out with Image**
```
POST /api/employee/:id/check-out-with-image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- image: File (JPG/PNG)
- type: 'checkout'

Response:
{
  "message": "Check-out successful",
  "checkOutTime": "05:00 PM",
  "hoursWorked": 8.0,
  "totalHoursToday": 8.0,
  "imagePath": "/uploads/attendance-images/123_checkout_1234567890.jpg",
  "date": "2024-01-01"
}
```

## üíª Installation & Setup

### **1. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

This will install the `multer` package for file uploads.

### **2. Directory Structure:**

The uploads directory is created automatically when the first image is uploaded:
```
Backend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attendance-images/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {employeeId}_checkin_{timestamp}.jpg
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {employeeId}_checkout_{timestamp}.jpg
```

### **3. Environment Configuration:**

No additional environment variables needed. Images are served from:
```
http://localhost:5000/uploads/attendance-images/{filename}
```

### **4. Start the Application:**

```bash
# Backend
cd Backend
npm start

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd Frontend
npm start
```

## üì± Camera Permissions

### **Browser Permissions Required:**
- Camera access must be granted
- Works on HTTPS or localhost
- Mobile and desktop compatible

### **Permission Denied Handling:**
- Error message displayed
- Retry button available
- User can close and try again

## üé® UI/UX Features

### **Camera Modal:**
- Fullscreen overlay with dark background
- Video preview with mirror effect
- Large capture button
- Retake and confirm options
- Smooth animations

### **Image Display (Admin):**
- 60x60px thumbnails in table
- Rounded corners
- Click to open full size in new tab
- "-" shown when no image available

## üîí Security Considerations

### **File Upload Security:**
1. **File Type Validation:** Only images allowed
2. **File Size Limit:** 5MB maximum
3. **Unique Filenames:** Prevents overwrites
4. **Directory Isolation:** Images in dedicated folder

### **Access Control:**
- Employees can only upload for their own ID
- Admin can view all images
- Images served through static middleware

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Camera Not Working:**
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost
- Try different browser
- Check console for errors

### **Images Not Displaying:**
- Verify backend is running
- Check network tab for 404 errors
- Ensure static files route is configured
- Check image paths in database

### **Upload Fails:**
- Check file size (< 5MB)
- Verify multer is installed
- Check backend logs
- Ensure uploads directory exists

## üìä Database Schema

### **Attendance Record:**
```javascript
{
  date: "2024-01-01",
  checkIn: "09:00 AM",
  checkOut: "05:00 PM",
  status: "Present",
  hours: 8.0,
  isLate: false,
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T09:00:00.000Z",
  checkInImage: "/uploads/attendance-images/123_checkin_1234567890.jpg",  // NEW
  checkOutImage: "/uploads/attendance-images/123_checkout_1234567890.jpg" // NEW
}
```
